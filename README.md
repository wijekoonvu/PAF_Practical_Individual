Doctor Registration Management
---------------------------------------------
Registration of the Doctors plays a vital role for both hospitals and patients. A new Doctor can be added by giving personal details such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Phone number, Specialization, Charges, and Doctor Type. Once the Registration form is submitted the details will stored in the "registereddoctor" table inside the "paf_db" Database. Furthermore, Registered doctor details can be updated and can be deleted from the "paf_db" database.
